Fruit Orchard
=============

The ``daf_fruit_orchard`` package is responsible for the heavy lifting necessary to flesh out a virtual environment capable
of building a python package.

The ``daf_fruit_seed`` script's job is simply to bootstrap things to a point where ``daf_fruit_orchard`` can take over the real
work.
