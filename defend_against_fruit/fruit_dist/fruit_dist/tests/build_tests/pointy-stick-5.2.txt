Ladies and gentlemen hobos and tramps,
bow-legged mosquitoes and not needed ants,
gather around closely and I'll tell you of something I know not about

Late last night and early in the morn
two dead boys got into a fight.

Back to back they faced each other,
drew their swords and shot one another.

A deaf policeman heard the noise,
and came and killed those two dead boys.
