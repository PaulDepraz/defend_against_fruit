A man named Works,a friend of mine,
had three red shirts on his line.

What think yee that man he did.
He bought a goat just for his kid.

That goat got lose one night at nine,
and ate those shirts right off the line.

This made Works mad and then he swore,
that he would get that old goats gore.

To the railroad tracks he tied him tight,
just as the train rolled into sight.

He struggled with all his might and mane,
coughed up those shirts and flagged the train.
