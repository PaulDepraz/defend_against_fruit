{"name":"Defend Against Fruit","tagline":"Continuous Deployment in Python","body":"### Vision\r\nDefend Against Fruit is focused on providing a pragmatic, continuous deployment-style build system for Python. Current Python build systems do not properly account for the needs of effective continuous deployment. This package extends the Python tooling to add the missing pieces.\r\n\r\nWith an eye to agile development principles and [fast feedback](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#fast-feedback-is-critical), we want a build system which satisfies the following goals:\r\n\r\n- Every SCM change-set committed should result in a potentially shippable release candidate.\r\n- When a defect is introduced, we want to immediately detect and isolate the offending SCM change-set. This is true even if the defect was introduced into a library we depend upon.\r\n- Library management should be so easy as to never impede code changes, even in multi-component architecture.\r\n\r\nFor in-depth documentation with lots of pretty diagrams, [take a look at the wiki](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki).\r\n\r\n<!-- [![Simplified CI Flow](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/SimplifiedCIFlow_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#wiki-simplified-ci-flow-dia) -->\r\n[![Cascading Dependencies](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/CascadingDependencies_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#wiki-cascading-deps-dia)\r\n[![Library Analogy](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/LibraryAnalogy_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#wiki-library-analogy-dia)\r\n<!-- [![Promotion Affects Visiblity](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/PromotionAffectsVisibility_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#wiki-promotion-affects-visiblity-dia) -->\r\n[![Collaboration Groups](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/ConfigurableCollaborationGroups_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki#wiki-collaboration-group-dia)\r\n[![Vendor Choices](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/HowToComponents_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/How-To#wiki-vendor-choices-dia)\r\n<!--\r\n[![Frequent Integration Minimizes Risk](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/ValueOfFrequentMerges_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/Frequent-Integration-Minimizes-Risk)\r\n[![Tooling Demands and Code Complexity](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/ToolingDemandsAndCodeComplexity_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/Tooling-Demands-and-Code-Complexity)\r\n[![Python Garden Dependency Graph](https://raw.github.com/wiki/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/diagrams/PythonGardenDependencyGraph_thumb.png)](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/How-To#wiki-python-garden-dependency-dia)\r\n -->\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThe majority of Defend Against Fruit has been co-developed by James Carpenter (@nawkboy) and Matthew Tardiff (@themattrix), but many others provided considerable assistance. \r\n\r\nFor more details, please see the [Authors and Contributors](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/Authors-And-Contributors) wiki page.\r\n\r\n### Finding Help\r\n\r\nPlease see the [Finding Help](https://github.com/teamfruit/defend_against_fruit/wiki/Finding-Help) wiki page for details.","google":"UA-40742495-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
